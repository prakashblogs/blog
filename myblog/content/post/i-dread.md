I dread 11 PM.  
I dread happy people.  
I dread happy people telling me happy stories  
At 11 PM on a Monday. Or any day of the week.  
I dread unbearable, continuous gossips,  
And I dread complete silence too.  
Silence in which I can hear my poor heart sing  
An elegy.  
For whom? I don't know.  
I dread being hard on myself,  
For things that were out of my control.  
I dread falling prey, to the pattern  
In which these events keep repeating.

I dread knowing, and I dread not knowing.  
I dread the day, when my mind would declare  
Victory over my heart, or vice-versa.
I dread meeting someone, whom I would want  
To shelter under my own skin.  
And not being able to explain it to them.

â€” PD
