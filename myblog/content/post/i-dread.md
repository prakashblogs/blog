I dread 11 PM.  
I dread happy people.  
I dread happy people  
Telling me happy stories  
At 11 PM on a Monday  
Or any day of the week.

I dread unbearable, continuous gossips  
And I dread complete silence too  
Silence in which I can hear  
My poor heart sing an elegy  
For whom? I don't know.

I dread being hard on myself,  
For things that were out of my control.  
I dread falling prey  
To the pattern in which  
These events keep repeating.

I dread knowing  
And I dread not knowing.  
I dread the day when  
My mind would declare  
Victory over my heart  
Or vice-versa.

I dread meeting someone  
Whom I would want to shelter  
Under my own skin  
And not being able to explain it to them.

â€” PD
