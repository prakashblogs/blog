It starts with the eyes, then come ears  
Follow them tongue, nose and skin

Eyes, I read about them in science class  
They have a blind spot, which makes sense, after all these years.  
It happened one Saturday morning,  
Like this one.  
Going through an old photo album

I thought,  
Where are they,

the people who were once visible,  
You could touch them.  
You saw them all over the place.  
Where are they now, I hope they exist.  
In the blind spot of my eyes.
