We ride the waves, I and you.  
On a wrecked down boat, far from shore.  
We are bruised a little, and ready for more.  
We make a world in our heads, and then,  
We put some sunlight in there, and some rain,  
In our world there is no-one, to wake us out of dream,  
There is no-one to get us,  
There are no f\*\*\*ing sprints.

There is a big rewind button,  
To play the sweet memories.  
And there is an erase button,  
to purge the bitter stories.  
I can turn into a sparrow,  
And come flying to you.  
This is a world I would wish for,  
If I could start anew.

â€” PD
